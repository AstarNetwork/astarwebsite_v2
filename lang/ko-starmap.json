Teams are inclined to choose one or the other when developing their project. This is why we created XVM. \n\nCross-Virtual Machine (XVM) is a custom pallet and a set of interfaces that allow a smart contract in one virtual machine to communicate with another, as if they are in the same environment. In other words, with XVM, you can create an ink! smart contract and access any assets or contracts available on the EVM side. You can enjoy the best of both worlds!"
