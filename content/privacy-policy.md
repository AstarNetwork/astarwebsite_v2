## Your Rights Over Your Personal Data

You may opt-out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us via the contact form given on our website. In certain circumstances, you can also exercise the rights available to you under the Personal Data Protection Act 2012 of Singapore as follows:

- Access - Request for a copy of the personal data we have about you if any, and request for information about how your personal data has been used and disclosed.
- Correction - Request change/correction or update to any personal data we have about you – this enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
- Right to withdraw consent at any time – in circumstances where we ask for your consent to process your personal data, any consent is provided freely and if you decide to withdraw you consent, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent, nor will it affect processing of your Personal Data conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain services to you and/or performing any contracts we may have with you, and this may also result in the termination of any contracts you have with us and your being in breach of your contractual obligations or undertakings, and our legal rights and remedies in such event are expressly reserved.

You may be charged with a reasonable fee for our processing of access requests, but not for processing a correction.. Please note that in some cases we may reject requests for certain reasons (for example, if the request is unlawful or if it may infringe on the rights of others or if the request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive).

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. However it could take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
